I Created a macOS App to Aid in Productivity: Introducing PixlPal

PixlPal is a macOS application that I developed to make it easier for designers, developers, social media influencers, YouTubers, streamers, video professionals, and anyone who works with colors to capture any color on their screen and automatically save it to their clipboard. With support for various color formats, including HSL, RGB, and HEX, PixlPal is ideal for anyone who needs to work with colors in their daily work.

## Who is PixlPal For?

PixlPal is designed for anyone who works with colors on their computer. Here are some examples of who could benefit from using PixlPal:

## Features

PixlPal offers several key features that make it easy to capture colors and use them in your work:

In addition to these features, I’m working on several new features that I plan to release soon, including a Windows version of PixlPal, a color history feature, and screen measurement tools.

## Future Plans

In addition to the features I’m working on now, I’m also exploring several other ideas for PixlPal’s future development, including:

* **Windows version:** PixlPal is currently only available for macOS, but I’m working on a Windows version to make it accessible to even more users.

* **Color history: **With the upcoming color history feature, PixlPal will allow you to easily access previously selected colors, so you can quickly reuse colors without having to select them again.

* **Screen Measurement Mode:** PixlPal’s upcoming screen measurement mode will allow you to measure distances in pixels on your screen with precision, whether you’re measuring images, divs, buttons or any other element. This will make it easier for designers and developers to ensure their designs are pixel-perfect, and will save them time by eliminating the need to use external screen measurement tools.

* **Support for additional color formats:** In the future, I’m planning to add support for additional color formats, such as CMYK and Pantone, to make PixlPal even more versatile and useful for designers, developers, and other professionals who work with colors.

Stay tuned for more updates and new features as I continue to develop PixlPal!
